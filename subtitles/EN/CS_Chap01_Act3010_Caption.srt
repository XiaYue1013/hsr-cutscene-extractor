1
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:10,866
I lost her... My wish, your so-called plan... What is the point of it all?

2
00:00:11,033 --> 00:00:19,700
Your grief... sorrow... useless sentiments... abandon them all...

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,100
Silence! She is my daughter, my only...

4
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:31,400
You soulless thing — how could you begin to fathom!? You will never understand... Never!

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,866
You did not lose her... She waits to be reunited with you on the other side.

6
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,800
A new world...

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Rise... guardian...

8
00:00:55,266 --> 00:01:02,233
Fulfill your destiny... Fulfill a mother's wish.
