00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:06,633
...Priorities? What do you mean? Are you saying rebuilding the Underworld isn't one of your "priorities"?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,866
Of course not! I'm just saying we have limited assets, and we need new parameters.

3
00:00:13,466 --> 00:00:17,766
Assets... parameters... You sure love your fancy words.

4
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:23,333
Ugh, forget it. Leave it to me. I'll go down myself... Ah!

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,000
...Come on, Seele! I won't leave you to—

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Look, Bronya!

7
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,333
...!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,333
There'll be plenty of difficulties waiting for them, right?

9
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:40,730
Yes... their future is filled with even more uncertainty than ours.

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,333
But we will prevail here... Even if it means arguments like this go on forever...

11
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:51,833
...Hmph, they won't go on forever if I win them.
