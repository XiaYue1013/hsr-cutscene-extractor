1
00:00:04,072 --> 00:00:05,272
All who enter here...

2
00:00:05,855 --> 00:00:06,655
...are either jailers...

3
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:07,914
...or prisoners.

4
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,566
Which are you?

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,153
Neither. I'm merely a lost traveler.

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,773
What a spectacle! The Stellaron, the Ambrosial Arbor, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, the Lord Ravager...

7
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,633
...a series of threats...

8
00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:29,933
...that almost succeeded in diverting attention away...

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:33,100
...from the crucial question...

10
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:37,083
They who brought the Stellaron onto the Xianzhou...

11
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:38,983
What was their motive?

12
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:42,879
Will you surrender...

13
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:44,550
...or do you require encouragement...

14
00:00:45,314 --> 00:00:46,716
...abomination of Yaoshi.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,083
General, my power does indeed stem from the Abundance.

16
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:53,298
But I'm the same as you.

17
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,816
We are both enemies of Yaoshi.

18
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:01,133
That's right, Jing Yuan.

19
00:01:02,283 --> 00:01:03,400
Stay out of our way.

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:11,233
The revival of the Arbor is an omen. It's time for the Xianzhou to choose its next path.

21
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:17,316
The Reignbow Arbiter, the Plagues Author, the Ruin Author...

22
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:25,133
This is a chess game between Aeons. If you don't stand with the winners, you stand to lose.

23
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:27,650
And this time,

24
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:31,016
We will put the Abundance in their grave.
