1
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:07,533
We were here once, seven hundred years ago...

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,800
...laughing, sparring... and thinking about the future.

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:27,233
Their faces still linger before my eyes, like a bygone dream.

4
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought those joyful days would flow indefinitely before us — like a Xianzhou lifetime.

5
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:46,333
Yet, dreams...

6
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:53,500
...will eventually fade — like clouds from the sky.
