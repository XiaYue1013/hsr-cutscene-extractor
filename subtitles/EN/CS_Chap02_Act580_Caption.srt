1
00:00:07,786 --> 00:00:09,952
Hahahahaha...

2
00:00:16,186 --> 00:00:20,552
I wonder if the transformation of a Xianzhou general into a Voidranger...

3
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:23,769
...would cast the Luofu back into chaos?

4
00:00:25,336 --> 00:00:28,769
Destruction works in fascinating ways...

5
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:29,786
Haha...

6
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:33,169
What are you—

7
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:45,669
Dan Heng! Do it—

8
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:10,436
Not bad, General of The Hunt...

9
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:14,269
But all I lost was a body stolen on a whim.

10
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:16,319
And you...

11
00:01:16,986 --> 00:01:18,902
How much longer can you last?

12
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:24,552
The destruction of the Xianzhou... is nigh.

13
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:26,986
Begone,

14
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:29,086
Pawn of Destruction.

15
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,669
Tell the Legion,

16
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,252
that the vengeance of The Hunt

17
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,019
will fall upon them.
